          <p class="text-muted">
                <li>Admission of students to the institution</li>

                Using an auto reply feature and a standard format, a student information system replies all the admission-related queries of students who may want to apply. Similarly, during the admission, the created database is used for sending admission letters or regret letters to the prospective students. During the enrolment of students the system stores all the main subject and optional subject details. This information is further used for automatic creation of subject classes and assignments to teachers. The details of students who seek hostel facilities are stored separately for allocating rooms and also providing boarding information to the hostel wardens.

                <li>Availability of information from a single source</li>

                Most of the student information systems are created with an objective to store details of quality information and make them available as an integrated system. Use of such online administrative and student information systems increases the functional efficiency of an institution and improves timely decision-making processes at all levels. Availability of a student records system containing all information details at a single source enables easy percolation of the right information.

                <li>Centralised information sourcing and management</li>

                Although the very objective of this intelligent student information management system is to tackle various issues related to students, administration and teachers, it offers a wider perspective by providing a complete information management solution. The centralised e-Advising offered by the current intelligent student information systems allows the students to send a pre-registration email to register. The web link included in the reply mail enables them to access a complete academic planning network which includes a gamut of information about various programmes, courses, fee structure, further progress, and other employment openings. Thus, students can compare the programmes and facilities available in various other institutions and make a choice on preferences. Current student information systems are designed in such a way as to provide all the comprehensive information in not more than three screen levels with customised applications and a single log in. This student information management system efficiently integrates all the information management functions of an institution right from the students’ level up to the level of the Registrar’s office. It even enables institutional study and forecast.

                <li>Centralised accounting and billing procedures</li>

                An intelligent student information system enables all accounting and billing functions while simultaneously managing the academic requirements of the students and the administration. The inbuilt accounting capabilities of the system’s software enable the running of all accounting and billing procedures without duplicating the efforts, such as having a parallel manual system. The available accounting modules include functions like maintaining a general ledger, billing for students, all payable and receivable details, and project funding and accounting details. The inbuilt automated contact management mailing in the system enables systematic, regular mails with details about any fee paid or to be paid by the students. The integrated shared database provides details of college, hostel, or any other fee receivable from a single source for easy follow-up and future auditing.

                <li>Monitoring student-related activities</li>

                A complete record of students’ attendance and leave details is stored in the system. The reminder option in the system informs the institution management about the irregularities in the attendance or leave details for further action. This system offers a complete follow-up on all the discipline records of the students. With appropriate inputs, it offers an easy follow-up on bad elements to maintain institutional discipline. The student information system facilitates recording of all communication details with the students for regular follow-up and future use.

                <li>Easy-to-use streamlined process</li>

                The computerized student information system enables compiling of all the data at a single source, especially that of students and teachers. This electronic storing of records cuts down the use of paper at all levels. Such an availability of all the required information in the electronic form facilitates easy retrieval, and also speeds up approval formalities. It is possible to store all student-related activities such as attendance, test performance, and exam schedules in the system and share these with the parents and other faculties. Integrating the student record systems with the inbuilt word processor or spreadsheet facilities allows merging of address details while sending postal communications to the students.

                <li>Easy scheduling of examinations</li>

                Scheduling of examination dates can be easily handled by a student information system. It correlates all details such as availability of teachers and completion of book syllabus fixed for the term before announcing the examination dates. Details about records of all written examinations, appraisals on the papers, marks or grades offered, and educational headway made by the students can be recorded for easy retrieval.

                <li>Integrating parents, teachers and administrators</li>

                Student information systems are integrated with the parents’ portal for regular update of student-related information and feedback. The advanced systems enable creation of a user name and password for protected access to such information. The real-time availability of all student-related information such as attendance, marks or grades obtained in term examinations, and class and examination timetables enables parents, teachers and administrators to interact using the web interface for improving the performance of students.

                <li>Arranging of financial aid</li>

                Currently, computerised student information systems play a vital role in helping deserving students to apply for financial aid for continuing education. With all the compiled details such as various financial aid opportunities, total fund availability, budget allocation, received applications with eligibility criteria, the system module can verify the applications and allot aid in a shorter duration. On the basis of the fed details the system even arranges for periodic and timely distribution of financial aid.

                <li>Managing placement services</li>

                The student information management systems keep track of all the eligible students for part-time placement services to supplement educational expenses. The institutional payroll department identifies the positions available within the university and encourages students to apply for them. Similarly, while arranging placement services for final-year students, the available comprehensive details in the student record systems are sent to prospective employers who offer campus placement services.
